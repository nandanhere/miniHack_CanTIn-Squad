## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Latest Version of Xcode : We used Xcode with IOs 13.2 so do change IOs target if your Xcode is not updated
 Note: If you directly download from this repository,make sure the pods are installed else the app wont run
 
### Installation
Download the zip file of the project or click on the "Open via Xcode" option in git.
Since the app utilises CocoaPods , you will need to initialise the pod files by installing them
-In terminal , navigate to the .xcodeproj / pods directory and type command "pod install" 
 this will install the required firebase files

### Deployment
On Xcode, Choose your Device or Simulator with IOs 13.2 (or higher) and click on the "Run" button or 'Cmd + r' shortcut key
